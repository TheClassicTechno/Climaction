# 💡Inspiration💡
With all of the climate crises occurring these days, we were inspired to create a web app that addresses environmental damage in two ways. Our first way is to advocate and raise awareness of climate change by hosting webinar series, partnering with green organizations, and giving petitions a bigger audience/platform by posting petitions onto our web page. Lastly, our second way is to provide an easy platform to schedule online events to encourage more people to create online events rather than in-person meetings, conferences, etc. This ensures that the amount of car or air travel would decrease.

# 🔥What it does🔥
This website has a page to sign up for webinar events that has popular figures and companies talk about what they are doing and what they have done to conserve the environment. This helps incentivize the common people and our webinar audience to do the same as well.

This website is also hosted on Microsoft Azure as it is deployed there and it is tied up with google cloud and amazon concepts. This website also has it’s github code hosted in google cloud.

# 🛠How we built it🛠
We built this using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. We also deployed the app on Microsoft Azure.

# 😩Challenges we ran into😩
After coming up with the idea, we were having trouble thinking of what exactly we should put in our website. We also struggled with whether to create a sign in/sign up page or just a registration page.

# 🎉Accomplishments that we're proud of🎉
We were able to create a functioning website in only 2 days, that has both the front end and back end done.

# 💨What we learned💨
We learned to collaborate and split tasks efficiently by communicating in discord. For example, one person worked on the backend, one person worked on the front end, one person worked on deploying the web app to azure, etc.

# 🍃What's next for Climaction🍃
To expand and add more webinar and advocacy events in our Climaction website.
